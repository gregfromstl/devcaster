This library was the first implementation of Farcaster frames that used JSX-based syntax and incorporated declarative asynchronous state management.

It has since been deprecated and kindly incorporated into [frames.js](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js). For future Frame development, I would recommend [Frog](https://frog.fm).
